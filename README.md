Development:
Android:
Android Studio with a set emulator should be running (Memory size should be set to a reasonable amount to allow Expo app to be installed onto the emulator (2GB was found to be sufficient))
Run the application in the emulator by performing the following commands:
"expo start"
Press "a" as prompted by the screen to run the application in the Android emulator
Any changes to the application source files require the application to be reloaded via the "r" prompt form the expo cli menu to refresh changes in the emulator. If this does not work, restart the application via the "expo start" command.
